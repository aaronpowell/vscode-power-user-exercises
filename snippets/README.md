# Snippets

Snippets are useful to create something that you can quickly enter in, maybe it's a common license header for all files, or the scaffolding for how you are structuring a React component.

Snippets can live within a workspace, or they can be user-wide.

You create snippets in the `.vscode` folder at the root of your workspace.

Check out [https://snippet-generator.app/](https://snippet-generator.app/) as an easy way to generate snippets.
