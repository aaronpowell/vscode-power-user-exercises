# Keyboard Shortcuts

VS Code has a lot to offer for people who want to use the keyboard predominately, and you can even create your own keyboard bindings.

Here's some that every user should know.

_Note: This is written for Windows keyboard, but on a Mac, generally replace `CTRL` with `CMD`._

- Open Settings: `CTRL + ,`
- Code Actions: `CTRL + .`
- Duplicate Line: `ALT + SHIFT + up/down arrow`
- Multi-line Selection: `CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + up/down`
- Split Editor Right: `CTRL + \`
- Split Editor Below: `CTRL + K, CTRL + \`
- Select Next Match: `CTRL + D`
- Side bar open/close: `CTRL + B`
- Keybindings reference: `CTRL + K, CTRL + R`
- Move lines: `ALT + up/down`
- Scroll window: `CTRL + up/down`
- Go to reference: `F12`
- Markdown preview: `CTRL + K, V`

Keyboard shortcuts can be made conditional as well, so you can change the bindings based on the language of a file, or other conditions in VS Code.
